# Challenge 2
## Portfolio project

## Desciption 
I built my Portfolio website to resemble two things. One it needed to look visually appealing and I wanted to have fun making it. I feel a portfolio doesn't only show what you're capable of artistically, but they also should show who you are as a person. If every web developer, artist or graphic designer just had a space showcasing their work but did not influence the site with their personality, I don't think that would be a very memorable portfolio. So with my portfolio I wanted to add a lot of color to it. But the colors also needed to make sense. I feel the colors I chose both compliment the header photo and help the entire page as a whole feel more cohesive and polished. That is also why I added some more color aspects to the page that I will go over more in the usage section of this README. But I am proud of the visual approach I took with the portfolio.
 
As far as issues, there were definitely some hurdles to jump over. Some of those hurdles still in my way if i'm being honest. One aspect that took way too long to figure out was having my header image have rounded corners on the bottom so it flowed into the rest of the site. I thought having a rectangle going across the page didn't imply there was more content on the page. Where as having the rounded edges on the photo, to me, makes me go "oh I should definitely scroll down and see what's next" but having the text block that says "link, the champion of hyrule" have the same radius and stay in that position when shrinking the page down was the big challenge but was happy with how it turned out. The other big issue I had was when I shrunk the page all the way to a mobile viewing, I wanted my profile photo to switch to a circle shape instead of the slightly rounded square in full screen mode, and then I wanted the five images to stack on top of each other like a column. And although I'm positive that there is a similar way of doing it than how I did it, I couldn't find that way, but I still got it to do what I wanted. Sorta.  
 
This was definitely a lot of fun! And it really helped me learn a flow of where to start when starting a page from scratch. At first I was very overwhelmed but quickly I got over that and was in love with messing around trying to get the page to do and look how I wanted. We were told that we could make the page how we want so I hope I didn't go overboard with it, but I guess I'll find out.

## Usage
 
As I stated in the description above, there is alot going on in my portfolio that maybe one wouldn't realize by just looking at it, and not interacting with it. For example, My name in the top left when you first open the page has a really awesome hover effect to it. Hovering over that not only changes the color of the rectangle, but also changes the color of my name too. and then reverts back to the teal when you are no longer hovering over it. And then I found about a CSS hover effect called "ease-in-out" which kind of fades in the color properties you apply to it, and you can add a "timer" so to speak to generate how long the transition from color to color, on hover, takes to change. And then going over to the nav bar, hovering over "About me" "Work" "Contact" "Resume" Turns the text to black and adds a slight shadow underneath the text to really add a subtle but very effective look to the portfolio. Also when you click on anything in the Nav, it takes you to that specific part of the portfolio. Pretty cool. Another aspect that's going on that you can't see unless you interact with it is the text selection/highlight effect. If you select any text on the entire page, you'll see that the text turns orange and the highlighted background turns gray. With the subtle gradient background color, the text highlight effect looks really cool I think. When you hover over the images in the work section of the page, each image will individually come in more clear and again adds the feeling of interactivity with the site. I also thought it was cool incorporating some of my art work and wife into this project too. The Footer nav does the same as the Navbar at the top of the page but takes it to another step too. Each element has the same hover effect as the nav at the top, but clicking on them actually opens up an entirely new tab (thank you to target="blank" also want to clarify a new tab will open for everything except my phone number, I didn't know what to link to my phone number). But clicking my email, should prompt your computer to open up your default email so you can send me an email directly. Github and Twitter will link to my GitHub and Twitter, and then the Apple music playlist will link to a playlist called "Anthems" that I add a bunch of music to all the time. Sorry it's not spotify.
