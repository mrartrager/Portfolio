        <p class="me">Hello! My Name is Matthew Waldron, and welcome to my portfolio! Feel free to browse around and take a look at some of my work.
            I have been a Graphic Designer for about 10 years and decided along the way that I really wanted to stand out from the other designers. 
            How am I dong that you may ask? Well this very portfolio is a prime example of how, everything you're looking at was all coded by me!
            Thats right, I thought sitting at a computer all day desiging logos wasn't nearly as fun as sitting at a computer all day making sure I didn't 
            forget a ";" anywhere.  Anyways, hope you enjoy.
